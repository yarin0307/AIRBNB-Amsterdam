            "neighborhood_overview": "Indische Buurt (\"Indies Neighborhood\") is a neighbourhood in the eastern portion of the city of Amsterdam, in the Dutch province of Noord-Holland. The name dates from the early 20th century and is derived from the fact that the neighbourhood's streets are named after islands and other geographical concepts in the former Dutch colony of the Dutch East Indies. The first street was named in 1902. In 2003, there were around 23,357 inhabitants. The neighbourhood is bounded on the west by the railroad Amsterdam - Hilversum (with the Muiderpoort Station), on the east side by Flevopark, on the north side by Zeeburgerdijk and on the south side by the Ringvaart Watergraafsmeer. Indische Buurt is the oldest part of the Zeeburg district and is very ethnically diverse, and a high percentage of the population is of immigrant origin (for Zeeburg this is already high at 55%, but higher in the Indische Buurt) and there are an estimated 100 languages spoken.",

We fell in love at first sight when Joanna went to Amsterdam to review boutique hotels and walked into the boutique hotel MP was running. The rest, as they say, is history. These days MP is a professional pianist and Joanna is distributor of Micro scooters for the Netherlands and has a store across the street from the house. In 2006 we bought our house from an old lady who had lived in it for 38 years. We have completely renovated it and now live here very happily with our two daughters. We love to travel, we love music and we love good food. We also really love Amsterdam! We can tip you off about local hangouts that you have to live here to know about and all the highlights that you really ought to see whilst you're here. This is the best area of the city to live in, that's why we picked it. Everything we need is right on our doorstep, we hardly ever have to leave our 'hood. You'll love it here too!",

I  work in private health care, specialized with dementia. I started out as a home exchanger, so I know how great it feels to have a home away form home when you visit a big city. After a long day full of walking and sight seeing it is wonderful to get home and lay on a sofa or take a bath and get a fresh soda from your own fridge without a mini bar bill!\r\r\n\r\r\nIf you have any questions please do not hesitate to contact me. If you like my house, please do not make a reservation request immediately, just send me a message. I never accept reservation requests without communicating with potential guests through email before. It is not a second home, but the house I live in. I do not rent it out to everybody.

I also love travelling and I always go to places where I know someone who can show me around and help me feel like a local, not just a tourist!\r\r\nMany years ago I started to rent out my home to other travellers because I wanted to share my love and knowledge for Amsterdam and show what a great place it can be just with a bike and tips from a local. There is so much to see in Amsterdam. I believe you deserve to see what's really worth it and not just the touristic areas. I truly hope you can enjoy Amsterdam as much as I do.\r\r\nI'll do my best to make you feel at home. How do I do it? First of all giving you a detailed map with loads of tips about restaurants, museums, coffee places where only locals go. Secondly providing you with tickets for anything you would like to see in advance, to avoid you waste of time. Transport cards, bikes, reservations for restaurants... Anything you might need!\r\r\nI now manage other B&B's and self-catered apartments in the city. If this B&B is already booked I can always offer you some alternative. Friendly and professional: that's what best describes my work ethics. Looking forward to welcoming you here. Ciao",

Rembrandtplein has several bars, two large nightclubs (Escape and Air), and â€˜old <br />worldâ€™ evocative treasures such as De Kroon and CafÃ© Schiller. The whole area is dotted with Amsterdam's beloved neighbourhood â€˜brown cafes'.<br /><br />The supermarket Albert Heijn and liquor store Gall&Gall are around the corner; when leaving the apt, turn left, follow the street leftwards and you'll see it in a glimpse.",

Especially to places where I can experience new things but also where I can just lounge by the pool, read a good book whilst soaking up the sun, feel the sand beneath my feet, admire the views and just enjoy the moment. I love to scuba dive and ski although I'm not very good at either of them. And I also love love love food! :) Travelling has taken a back seat in the last year though as I'm now spending most of my time with my baby boy. Having said that, this has allowed me to explore Amsterdam in a different light. :)\r\r\n\r\r\nIf you have any special requests for your stay or need information on places to go, eat, drink, be merry in Amsterdam or outside, please do not hesitate to drop me a line. I will try to answer you as best as I can to make your stay here as pleasant and comfortable as possible. We'd love to welcome you to our beautiful city!",
